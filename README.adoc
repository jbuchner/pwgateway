= Powerwall plugin for TeslaSolarCharger

This plugin makes it possible to use the https://github.com/pkuehnel/TeslaSolarCharger[TeslaSolarCharger] together with a Tesla Powerwall. All values required by the TeslaSolarCharger can be retrieved via this plugin.


== Configuring the Docker image

Add the following lines to the `docker-compose.yml` file of Teslasolarcharger:

[source, yaml]
----
pwplugin:
    image: jbuchner/pwplugin:latest
    container_name: pwplugin
    restart: always
    environment:
      - POWERWALL=<Host or IP>
      - USER_EMAIL=<Email>
      - USER_PASSWORD=<Password>
      - TZ=<TZ>
    ports:
      - 8081:80
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-file: "5"
        max-size: "10m"
----

Replace the variables `<Host or IP>`, `<Email>`, `<Password>` and `<TZ>` with the appropriate values for your Powerwall.

*Note*: `<Email>` and `<Password>` are not the credentials for your Tesla account (which you use in your car and your app), but different credentials for your Powerwall.

As value for TZ use the appropriate TZ identifier from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones. For example, use the value `Europe/Berlin` for Germany.

Use

[source, sh]
----
docker compose up -d
----

to start the containers.

You can check the installation by entering the following URL in your Browser:

`http://localhost:8081/soc`

If the TeslaSolarCharger is running on a different computer, you will have to modify the URL accordingly.

The plugin should return the SoC of your Powerwall in this form:

`{"raw_soc":30,"adjusted_soc":27}`

== Adjusted and unadjusted state of charge

The Tesla API provides values for the state of charge that differ from the state of charge displayed in the app. When the app displays the value 0%, the API returns the value 5%.

The endpoint `/soc` provides both the state of charge provided by the API (`$.raw_soc`) and an adjusted value that corresponds approximately to the value displayed in the app (`$.adjusted_soc`).

If you want to use the value provided by the API, you have to adjust the configuration as follows:
